Performing EDA on a human resource dataset in order to create a model for employee quit probability prediction.

We know that hiring and retaining employees are incredibly complex tasks that require significant investment of both capital and time. 
Companies allocate around 15%-20% of employees' salaries towards recruiting new candidates, while small business owners spend approximately 40% of their working hours on non-income generating activities such as hiring (source: https://toggl.com/blog/cost-of-hiring-an-employee).

This challenge leads to a revenue loss ranging between 1% and 2.5%. Furthermore, the average cost of hiring a new employee amounts to $7,645, and it takes an average of 52 days to fill a vacant position.

In light of this, my objective here is to develop a model that can predict which employees are more likely to quit. 
Our dataset encompasses various factors including job involvement, education, job satisfaction, performance, work-life balance, and relationship satisfaction (source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset).

## Conclusions summary:

1. mean age of the employees who stayed is higher compared to who left;
2. rate of employees who stayed is higher;
3. employees who stayed live closer to home;
4. employees who stayed are generally more satisifed with their jobs5;
5. employees who stayed tend to have higher stock option level.
